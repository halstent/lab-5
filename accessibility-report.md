# Project Accessibility Report

### Question 1.

- Each game in this program comes with a set of rules which the user can read if they are unfamiliar
- The program uses an in-game currency and every user begins with the same amount thus every player starts
  from equal circumstances

### Question 2.

We would market this program as an app towards anyone who is looking for a fun game to play solo or with their
friends. The program has games which can be played individually and a leaderboard for comparing high scores
and other stats.
Alternatively, this program could be advertised as an educational tool for students to learn about the
consequences of gambling in a safe environment.

### Question 3.

The program of course requires a device to run the application as well as some basic technological skills
to navigate the menus and displays. Additionally, although each game presents their rules to the player if they
are unfamiliar, just having a limited variety of games may discourage some inexperienced users.
