# Project Accessibility Report

### Question 1.

**Principle 1: Equitable Use**
- Every player begins with the same number of tokens when they first create an account. Every action that
the user takes after their initial sign up is based largely on luck, rather than privilege of experience.

**Principle 2: Flexibility in Use**
- There is a variety of games available for the user to play. There are three options with the capability to 
add more in the future, as well as multiplayer interactions if the user prefers collaborative experiences.

**Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use**
- Each game comes with its own set of rules for the user to view if they are unfamiliar with a game. The 
instructions are designed to cater to inexperienced individuals trying to learn.

**Principle 4: Perceptible Information**
- The visual display of the program has been optimized to be coherent during the user's entire playtime. 
This means the design is consistent with a similar colour scheme and coordinated button layout throughout.

**Principle 5: Tolerance for Error**
- There is some tolerance for error within the program, but it could admittedly have a broader range of acceptance.
In the sign-up and log-in pages there is checking if the user forgets their information or chooses and invalid
username.

**Principle 6: Low Physical Effort**
- As with most computer programs, the physical effort required is almost negligible as the user needs only a 
cursor and a keyboard to access the full capabilities of the application. In addition, the keyboard is only 
required to log in and for one of the games, thus the vast majority of the program only requires clicks.

**Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use**
- Building on the response for _Principle 6_, the application only requires clicks and typing for full use.
There is no difficult timed-interaction events, meaning the user can pause their playing at any point
during program use without penalization.

### Question 2.

We would market this program as an app towards anyone who is looking for a fun game to play solo or with their
friends. The program has games which can be played individually and a leaderboard for comparing high scores
and other stats.
Alternatively, this program could be advertised as an educational tool for students to learn about the
consequences of gambling in a safe environment. Allowing the potential students to reach 0 tokens teaches 
about the negatives of gambling but giving access to an unlimited shop encourages perseverance.

### Question 3.

The program of course requires a device to run the application as well as some basic technological skills
to navigate the menus and displays. Additionally, although each game presents their rules to the player if they
are unfamiliar, just having a limited variety of games may discourage some inexperienced users.
It could also be argued that the application is less likely to be used by elderly and very young users 
as the steps to download and play the games require some computer skills.
