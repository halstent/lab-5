## User Stories
- Team: A welcome page where a new user signs up for our system or logs in if they already have an account. 
The user can log out after logging in.

- Halsten: A user wants to get tokens, so they navigate to the shop and can either spin the hourly token wheel to 
receive different bundles of tokens (can range from 1-100 tokens) or click a button for one token.

- Samjir: A user wants to play the over/under card game (guess if the next card will be higher or lower than the 
current card). The user must enter a bet (must be at least the minimum bet) prior to playing the game. 
Depending on whether they win or lose, the bet will be deducted or added to their total tokens

- Val: A user wants to play the 50/50 gauntlet game (coinflip + dice roll + rock, paper, and scissors in sequence, 
the user must win all minigames) The user must guess each occurance correctly to win the game and receive their 
initial bet.

- Jashvir: As a user, I want to play blackjack (standard rules). As a player, I want to bet a certain amount that I 
either win or lose depending on the outcome of the game. As a player, I want to be able to see my hand and be able to
stand, ending my turn, or hit, adding a card to my hand. As a player, I want to be able to see the outcome of the game
depending on the moves I have made and my hand.

- Emma: A user wants to see their stats (current tokens, wins, losses, win %, etc.). The user also wants to check the 
leaderboard to compare their stats against the top users.
